        <p>In a rapidly advancing digital world, a college's ability to adapt to new technologies is essential to preparing students for the modern workforce. Marist College stands out as a leader in tech-forward education, thanks in large part to its long-standing partnership with IBM, one of the world's most influential technology companies. For over 30 years, Marist and IBM have collaborated on research, development, and educational initiatives that place Marist at the forefront of innovation in higher education. The result is a campus where students don't just learn about the future — they help shape it.

The Marist-IBM partnership began in the early 1980s and has only grown stronger since. What started as a collaboration focused on mainframe computing and infrastructure has evolved into a wide-reaching relationship that now includes cloud computing, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, analytics, and data science. Through this partnership, Marist became one of the first liberal arts colleges in the country to integrate enterprise-level IT systems into its campus operations — and more importantly, into its curriculum. Students studying computer science, information systems, business, and communications all benefit from access to IBM technologies, tools, and mentorship.

One of the clearest signs of this collaboration is the Enterprise Computing Research Lab (ECRL), a facility on campus where students, faculty, and IBM professionals work side by side on cutting-edge projects. Students can participate in real-world research while still completing their undergraduate degree. These projects often involve solving actual business or technical challenges, giving Marist students not just experience but impactful portfolio pieces that set them apart after graduation. The ECRL environment mirrors what they might encounter in a future tech job, allowing them to gain confidence in their skills and teamwork ability long before entering the workforce.

Another benefit of this partnership is Marist's early move into cloud-based education. The college was one of the first in the nation to deploy cloud infrastructure to deliver digital services — from course management systems to virtual labs. This wasn't just a convenience; it reflected a larger vision of flexible, scalable, and secure learning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Marist's infrastructure made it far easier for the college to pivot quickly to online and hybrid models without the disruptions many other schools faced. Students could access course materials, software, and even lab environments from anywhere in the world, giving them a strong sense of continuity and support.

Beyond just technical access, the IBM partnership gives Marist students industry-level credentials and certifications. Through IBM's SkillsBuild platform and on-campus training programs, students can earn micro-credentials in areas like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud architecture — skills that are in high demand by employers. These certifications enhance resumes and give Marist graduates a serious advantage when applying for jobs in tech, business, or any industry undergoing digital transformation.

But what truly sets Marist apart is its vision of integrating technology across all academic disciplines, not just in STEM. Students in communications use analytics to measure audience engagement, political science majors study digital ethics and misinformation, and artists explore digital design and media production. Technology isn't isolated to a computer lab — it's part of the broader learning culture. The college sees digital literacy as a critical skill for all students, regardless of their major, and the IBM partnership helps support this mission across departments.

The benefits extend into student life as well. Marist offers high-speed networking, virtual collaboration tools, smart classrooms, and 24/7 tech support services that create a smooth, connected campus experience. Students are also encouraged to bring their own ideas to the table. Whether launching startups, joining hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects, Marist students are empowered to explore technology beyond assignments and grades.

In conclusion, Marist College's partnership with IBM is more than a historical footnote — it's a living, active collaboration that continues to shape the way Marist educates, innovates, and grows. By combining the flexibility and focus of a liberal arts education with the technological muscle of one of the world's leading tech companies, Marist has created a powerful platform for student success. As technology continues to evolve, Marist is not just keeping up — it's helping lead the way.</p>
