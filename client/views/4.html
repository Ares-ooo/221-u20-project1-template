        Gachiakuta explores themes of worth, redemption, and what society chooses to discard. 
        Characters grapple with rejection, trying to find meaning in a world that labels them as garbage. 
        The constant presence of trash becomes a metaphor for overlooked humanity and untapped potential. 
        The story questions who decides what—and who—is truly worthless. 
        Through these themes, Gachiakuta becomes a story not just about survival, but about finding value in the broken and forgotten.
