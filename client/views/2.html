        Gachiakuta's art style blends gritty realism with sharp, dynamic lines that bring each chaotic scene to life. 
        The designs often feature intricate details on discarded items, emphasizing the importance of trash as both environment and symbol. 
        Shadows are used heavily, adding mood and intensity to emotional moments, while action scenes explode with exaggerated motion and raw energy. 
        The color palette leans toward muted tones mixed with occasional splashes of vivid color, reflecting the duality of hope and decay. 
        Altogether, the style gives Gachiakuta its unique visual identity, leaving readers captivated by every panel.
